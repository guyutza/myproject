# A new database design for ShopAlot.com.
This is a new kind of service called “parking lot shopping.” To reduce the traffic inside
busy stores such as grocery stores, users who know exactly what they want and verify that it's available will be able to
submit their orders for goods in advance and then wait in the parking lot. 
From there, designated "shoppers" -- ShopALot.com employees -- will be assigned their orders and will shop for them in batches and then 
perform the handoff to ShopALot customers from the comfort of the customers’ cars in store parking lots.

###### P.S. The Conceptual Design is the E-R Model in the directory.
